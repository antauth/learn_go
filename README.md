# Learn Go

I plan to do the following.

[] https://tour.golang.org

[x] https://golang.org/doc/code.html To learn how to organize your Go workspace

[] https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html which would help you be more effective at writing Go

[] https://golang.org/ref/spec will help you learn more about the language itself

[] https://golang.org/doc/#articles For a lot more reading material

Once complete, I will check out the following while trying to think of a project.

There are some awesome websites as well:
- https://blog.gopheracademy.com Well great resources for Gophers in general
- http://gotime.fm For a weekly podcast of Go awesomeness
- https://gobyexample.com If you are looking for examples of how to do things in Go
- http://go-database-sql.org If you are looking for how to use SQL databases in Go
- http://gophervids.appspot.com For a list of Go related videos from various authors

https://github.com/golang/go/wiki#learning-more-about-go will give a list of more resources to learn G
